    "In unsupervised learning,\n",

    "If the coin is *fair*,\n",
    "then both outcomes\n",

    "for every possible outcome\n",
    "with $n_\\textrm{h}$ heads and $n_\\textrm{t} = (n - n_\\textrm{h})$ tails,\n",
    "there is an equally likely outcome\n",
    "with $n_\\textrm{t}$ heads and $n_\\textrm{h}$ tails.\n",
    "Note that this is only possible\n",
    "if on average we expect to see\n",
    "$1/2$ of tosses come up heads\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the quantity $1/2$ is called a *probability*\n",

    "A probability of $1$ indicates absolute certainty\n",
    "(imagine a trick coin where both sides were heads)\n",
    "and a probability of $0$ indicates impossibility\n",

    "## Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When we spoke about events like the roll of a die\n",
    "coming up odds or the first coin toss coming up heads,\n",
    "we were invoking the idea of a *random variable*.\n",
    "Formally, random variables are mappings\n",
    "from an underlying sample space\n",
    "to a set of (possibly many) values.\n",
    "You might wonder how a random variable\n",
    "is different from the sample space,\n",
    "since both are collections of outcomes.\n",
    "Importantly, random variables can be much coarser\n",
    "than the raw sample space.\n",
    "We can define a binary random variable like \"greater than 0.5\"\n",
    "even when the underlying sample space is infinite,\n",
    "e.g., points on the line segment between $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "Additionally, multiple random variables\n",
    "can share the same underlying sample space.\n",
    "For example \"whether my home alarm goes off\"\n",
    "and \"whether my house was burgled\"\n",
    "are both binary random variables\n",
    "that share an underlying sample space.\n",
    "Consequently, knowing the value taken by one random variable\n",
    "can tell us something about the likely value of another random variable.\n",
    "Knowing that the alarm went off,\n",
    "we might suspect that the house was likely burgled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every value taken by a random variable corresponds\n",
    "to a subset of the underlying sample space.\n",
    "Thus the occurrence where the random variable $X$\n",
    "takes value $v$, denoted by $X=v$, is an *event*\n",
    "and $P(X=v)$ denotes its probability.\n",
    "Sometimes this notation can get clunky,\n",
    "and we can abuse notation when the context is clear.\n",
    "For example, we might use $P(X)$ to refer broadly\n",
    "to the *distribution* of $X$, i.e.,\n",
    "the function that tells us the probability\n",
    "that $X$ takes any given value.\n",
    "Other times we write expressions\n",
    "like $P(X,Y) = P(X) P(Y)$,\n",
    "as a shorthand to express a statement\n",
    "that is true for all of the values\n",
    "that the random variables $X$ and $Y$ can take, i.e.,\n",
    "for all $i,j$ it holds that $P(X=i \\textrm{ and } Y=j) = P(X=i)P(Y=j)$.\n",
    "Other times, we abuse notation by writing\n",
    "$P(v)$ when the random variable is clear from the context.\n",
    "Since an event in probability theory is a set of outcomes from the sample space,\n",
    "we can specify a range of values for a random variable to take.\n",
    "For example, $P(1 \\leq X \\leq 3)$ denotes the probability of the event $\\{1 \\leq X \\leq 3\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a subtle difference\n",
    "between *discrete* random variables,\n",
    "like flips of a coin or tosses of a die,\n",
    "and *continuous* ones,\n",
    "like the weight and the height of a person\n",
    "sampled at random from the population.\n",
    "In this case we seldom really care about\n",
    "someone's exact height.\n",
    "Moreover, if we took precise enough measurements,\n",
    "we would find that no two people on the planet\n",
    "have the exact same height.\n",
    "In fact, with fine enough measurements,\n",
    "you would never have the same height\n",
    "when you wake up and when you go to sleep.\n",
    "There is little point in asking about\n",
    "the exact probability that someone\n",
    "is 1.801392782910287192 meters tall.\n",
    "Instead, we typically care more about being able to say\n",
    "whether someone's height falls into a given interval,\n",
    "say between 1.79 and 1.81 meters.\n",
    "In these cases we work with probability *densities*.\n",
    "The height of exactly 1.80 meters\n",
    "has no probability, but nonzero density.\n",
    "To work out the probability assigned to an interval,\n",
    "we must take an *integral* of the density\n",
    "over that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that we could not even\n",
    "make it through the previous section without\n",
    "making statements involving interactions\n",
    "among multiple random variables\n",
    "(recall $P(X,Y) = P(X) P(Y)$).\n",
    "Most of machine learning\n",
    "is concerned with such relationships.\n",
    "Here, the sample space would be\n",
    "the population of interest,\n",
    "say customers who transact with a business,\n",
    "photographs on the Internet,\n",
    "or proteins known to biologists.\n",
    "Each random variable would represent\n",
    "the (unknown) value of a different attribute.\n",
    "Whenever we sample an individual from the population,\n",
    "we observe a realization of each of the random variables.\n",
    "Because the values taken by random variables\n",
    "correspond to subsets of the sample space\n",
    "that could be overlapping, partially overlapping,\n",
    "or entirely disjoint,\n",
    "knowing the value taken by one random variable\n",
    "can cause us to update our beliefs\n",
    "about which values of another random variable are likely.\n",
    "If a patient walks into a hospital\n",
    "and we observe that they\n",
    "are having trouble breathing\n",
    "and have lost their sense of smell,\n",
    "then we believe that they are more likely\n",
    "to have COVID-19 than we might\n",
    "if they had no trouble breathing\n",
    "and a perfectly ordinary sense of smell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with multiple random variables,\n",
    "we can construct events corresponding\n",
    "to every combination of values\n",
    "that the variables can jointly take.\n",
    "The probability function that assigns\n",
    "probabilities to each of these combinations\n",
    "(e.g. $A=a$ and $B=b$)\n",
    "is called the *joint probability* function\n",
    "and simply returns the probability assigned\n",
    "to the intersection of the corresponding subsets\n",
    "of the sample space.\n",
    "The *joint probability* assigned to the event\n",
    "where random variables $A$ and $B$\n",
    "take values $a$ and $b$, respectively,\n",
    "is denoted $P(A = a, B = b)$,\n",
    "where the comma indicates \"and\".\n",
    "Note that for any values $a$ and $b$,\n",
    "it follows that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A=a, B=b) \\leq P(A=a) \\textrm{ and } P(A=a, B=b) \\leq P(B = b),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since for $A=a$ and $B=b$ to happen,\n",
    "$A=a$ has to happen *and* $B=b$ also has to happen.\n",
    "Interestingly, the joint probability\n",
    "tells us all that we can know about these\n",
    "random variables in a probabilistic sense,\n",
    "and can be used to derive many other\n",
    "useful quantities, including recovering the\n",
    "individual distributions $P(A)$ and $P(B)$.\n",
    "To recover $P(A=a)$ we simply sum up\n",
    "$P(A=a, B=v)$ over all values $v$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio $\\frac{P(A=a, B=b)}{P(A=a)} \\leq 1$\n",
    "turns out to be extremely important.\n",
    "It is called the *conditional probability*,\n",
    "and is denoted via the \"$\\mid$\" symbol:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(B=b \\mid A=a) = P(A=a,B=b)/P(A=a).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It tells us the new probability\n",
    "associated with the event $B=b$,\n",
    "once we condition on the fact $A=a$ took place.\n",
    "We can think of this conditional probability\n",
    "as restricting attention only to the subset\n",
    "of the sample space associated with $A=a$\n",
    "and then renormalizing so that\n",
    "all probabilities sum to 1.\n",
    "Conditional probabilities\n",
    "are in fact just ordinary probabilities\n",
    "and thus respect all of the axioms,\n",
    "as long as we condition all terms\n",
    "on the same event and thus\n",
    "restrict attention to the same sample space.\n",

    "1. Give an example where observing more data can reduce the amount of uncertainty about the outcome to an arbitrarily low level.\n",
    "1. Give an example where observing more data will only reduce the amount of uncertainty up to a point and then no further. Explain why this is the case and where you expect this point to occur.\n",
    "1. We empirically demonstrated convergence to the mean for the toss of a coin. Calculate the variance of the estimate of the probability that we see a head after drawing $n$ samples.\n",
    "    1. How does the variance scale with the number of observations?\n",
    "    1. Use Chebyshev's inequality to bound the deviation from the expectation.\n",
    "    1. How does it relate to the central limit theorem?\n",
    "1. Assume that we draw $m$ samples $x_i$ from a probability distribution with zero mean and unit variance. Compute the averages $z_m \\stackrel{\\textrm{def}}{=} m^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^m x_i$. Can we apply Chebyshev's inequality for every $z_m$ independently? Why not?\n",
    "1. Given two events with probability $P(\\mathcal{A})$ and $P(\\mathcal{B})$, compute upper and lower bounds on $P(\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B})$ and $P(\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{B})$. Hint: graph the situation using a [Venn diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram).\n",
    "1. Assume that we have a sequence of random variables, say $A$, $B$, and $C$, where $B$ only depends on $A$, and $C$ only depends on $B$, can you simplify the joint probability $P(A, B, C)$? Hint: this is a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).\n",
    "1. In :numref:`subsec_probability_hiv_app`, assume that the outcomes of the two tests are not independent. In particular assume that either test on its own has a false positive rate of 10% and a false negative rate of 1%. That is, assume that $P(D =1 \\mid H=0) = 0.1$ and that $P(D = 0 \\mid H=1) = 0.01$. Moreover, assume that for $H = 1$ (infected) the test outcomes are conditionally independent, i.e., that $P(D_1, D_2 \\mid H=1) = P(D_1 \\mid H=1) P(D_2 \\mid H=1)$ but that for healthy patients the outcomes are coupled via $P(D_1 = D_2 = 1 \\mid H=0) = 0.02$.\n",
    "    1. Work out the joint probability table for $D_1$ and $D_2$, given $H=0$ based on the information you have so far.\n",
    "    1. Derive the probability that the patient is diseased ($H=1$) after one test returns positive. You can assume the same baseline probability $P(H=1) = 0.0015$ as before.\n",
    "    1. Derive the probability that the patient is diseased ($H=1$) after both tests return positive.\n",
    "1. Assume that you are an asset manager for an investment bank and you have a choice of stocks $s_i$ to invest in. Your portfolio needs to add up to $1$ with weights $\\alpha_i$ for each stock. The stocks have an average return $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = E_{\\mathbf{s} \\sim P}[\\mathbf{s}]$ and covariance $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\textrm{Cov}_{\\mathbf{s} \\sim P}[\\mathbf{s}]$.\n",
    "    1. Compute the expected return for a given portfolio $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$.\n",
    "    1. If you wanted to maximize the return of the portfolio, how should you choose your investment?\n",
    "    1. Compute the *variance* of the portfolio.\n",
    "    1. Formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the return while keeping the variance constrained to an upper bound. This is the Nobel-Prize winning [Markovitz portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markowitz_model) :cite:`Mangram.2013`. To solve it you will need a quadratic programming solver, something way beyond the scope of this book.\n"
